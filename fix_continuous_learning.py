The agent DOESN'T actually "know" if someone is 35-45 years old!
Instead, it uses PROXY TARGETING:

1. PLATFORM TARGETING CAPABILITIES:
   - Facebook: Age targeting (25-34, 35-44, 45-54, etc.)
   - Google: Affinity audiences ("Parents", "New Parents")
   - TikTok: Interest targeting ("Parenting", "Mental Health")

2. KEYWORD TARGETING (Google Search):
   - "teen mental health help" ‚Üí Likely a parent
   - "parenting difficult teenager" ‚Üí Parent 35-50
   - "my child depression" ‚Üí Parent
   - "anxiety coping techniques" ‚Üí Could be teen or adult

3. BEHAVIORAL TARGETING:
   - Visited parenting websites ‚Üí Parent audience
   - Searched college prep ‚Üí Parent of teen
   - Downloaded parenting apps ‚Üí Active parent

4. LOOKALIKE AUDIENCES:
   - Based on your existing converters
   - Platform finds similar users
   - Don't need to know exact age

When agent selects 'parents_35_45', it's really selecting:

FACEBOOK:
- Age: 35-44 ‚úì
- Interests: Parenting, Family, Education
- Behaviors: Parents with teenagers

GOOGLE SEARCH:
- Keywords: "teen anxiety", "child mental health", etc.
- Affinity: "Parents" audience
- In-market: "Family software"

TIKTOK:
- Interests: #MentalHealthAwareness, #ParentingTeens
- Custom audiences: Website visitors who viewed parenting content
- Lookalikes: Similar to converters

The RESPONSE MODEL then simulates realistic CVRs:
- 'parents_35_45' + 'teen anxiety keyword' = 4.5% CVR
- 'parents_50+' + 'generic parenting' = 0.3% CVR

1. CONTINUOUS LEARNING:
   - Remove budget stopping condition OR
   - Reset budget daily but keep Q-tables
   - Track cumulative episodes

2. AI INSIGHTS:
   - Store discoveries as they happen
   - Don't rely only on Q-table access
   - Show progressive learning

3. ATTRIBUTION:
   - Initialize with estimates
   - Update with real conversions
   - Show attribution even with few conversions

4. AUDIENCE CLARITY:
   - Document that it's platform targeting
   - Not individual user tracking
   - Based on aggregated patterns
