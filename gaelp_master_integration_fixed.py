# TEMPORARY FIX - Remove orphaned code from exception handler
# Lines 537-543 should be removed from gaelp_master_integration.py

# The exception handler should end cleanly after the raise statement:

"""
        except ImportError as e:
            logger.error(f"Advanced agent is REQUIRED: {e}")
            raise RuntimeError(f"AdvancedRLAgent is REQUIRED. Install dependencies and fix imports. No fallbacks allowed: {e}")
        
        # Keep online_learner reference for compatibility but use RL agent
        self.online_learner = self.rl_agent
"""

# The orphaned lines that need to be removed:
# Line 537:     epsilon_decay=0.995,
# Line 538:     epsilon_min=0.01, 
# Line 539:     checkpoint_dir="checkpoints/rl_agent",
# Line 540:     discovery_system=DynamicDiscoverySystem()
# Line 541: )
# Line 542: self.rl_agent.load_checkpoint()
