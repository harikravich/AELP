# GAELP TODO - January 29, 2025

## âœ… COMPLETED TODAY

### 1. Fixed Dashboard Issues
- âœ… Fixed AttributeError: Added `self.channel_performance` initialization
- âœ… Fixed AttributeError: Changed `self.rl_agent.memory` to `self.rl_agent.replay_buffer`
- âœ… Fixed TypeError: Convert action dict to integer index for RL training
- âœ… Fixed 100% win rate: Reduced bids from $4-7 to $2.50-5.00 for realistic 20% win rate
- âœ… Fixed $0 spend: Increased minimum budget to $1000, fixed bid amounts
- âœ… Fixed episode counting: Episodes increment every 25 steps instead of 100

### 2. Speed Improvements
- âœ… Simulation now runs at 100 steps/second (was 10)
- âœ… Spending rate: ~$2/second (was ~$0.01/second)
- âœ… Episodes complete faster (25 steps vs 100)
- âœ… RL training every 10 auctions for faster learning

### 3. Data Flow Fixes
- âœ… String-to-float conversion for Decimal types from master
- âœ… Auction tracking passed from master to dashboard
- âœ… Added debug logging for channel tracking
- âœ… Connected creative performance to actual metrics

### 4. Architecture Decisions
- âœ… Confirmed current simulation is sufficient (no need for AdSim)
- âœ… Using Criteo model for CTR prediction
- âœ… Realistic second-price auctions with 9 competitors
- âœ… Proper RL training with DQN and experience replay

## ðŸ”§ REMAINING ISSUES

### 1. Channel Performance Not Showing
- **Problem**: Channel data shows 0 despite wins happening
- **Root Cause**: `won` variable in dashboard is False even when auctions are won
- **Next Step**: Debug step_info structure from master to dashboard

### 2. Attribution Not Tracking
- **Problem**: No conversions showing in attribution
- **Root Cause**: Conversions have delay (1-30 days) but dashboard expects immediate
- **Next Step**: Implement proper delayed conversion tracking

### 3. AI Learning Insights Empty
- **Problem**: No segments discovered even after 50+ episodes
- **Root Cause**: Q-table not being properly analyzed for patterns
- **Next Step**: Fix segment discovery from RL agent Q-table

### 4. Creative Performance Shows 0 CTR
- **Problem**: Impressions tracked but no clicks
- **Root Cause**: Click simulation working but not connected to creative tracking
- **Next Step**: Connect click events to creative performance

## ðŸ“‹ TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES

1. **Fix Channel Tracking**
   - Debug why `won` is False in dashboard
   - Ensure step_info contains auction results
   - Verify channel data flows to display

2. **Implement Delayed Conversions**
   - Connect DelayedConversionSystem to dashboard
   - Show pending vs realized conversions
   - Update attribution when conversions realize

3. **Fix Segment Discovery**
   - Analyze Q-table for high-value state-action pairs
   - Extract segments with 100+ observations
   - Display discovered segments after 50 episodes

4. **Complete RL Training Loop**
   - Verify experience replay working
   - Monitor Q-value convergence
   - Show learning metrics in dashboard

## ðŸ’¡ KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working
- Realistic win rates (20% not 100%)
- Money flowing ($2/second spending)
- RL agent training without errors
- Auction mechanics realistic

### What's Not Working
- Channel performance display (data not flowing)
- Attribution tracking (no conversions)
- Segment discovery (not analyzing Q-table)
- Creative CTR (clicks not tracked)

### Architecture Notes
- Dashboard correctly shows simulation state
- Problem is data flow, not calculation
- Master â†’ Dashboard connection needs debugging
- All 19 components exist but not all connected

## ðŸš€ QUICK START FOR NEXT SESSION

```bash
# 1. Start dashboard
cd /home/hariravichandran/AELP
python3 gaelp_live_dashboard_enhanced.py

# 2. Monitor spending
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/status | jq '.metrics'

# 3. Check for errors
tail -f /tmp/dashboard.log 2>/dev/null || echo "No log file"

# 4. Debug channel tracking
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/status | jq '.channel_performance'
```

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT METRICS (as of session end)
- Spend Rate: ~$2/second
- Win Rate: ~20%
- Episodes: Completing every 2-3 seconds
- RL Training: Every 10 auctions
- Channels: Data not displaying (bug)
- Segments: Not discovered yet (need 50+ episodes)
