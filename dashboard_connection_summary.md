## How Continuous Learning Works

```python
Episode 1: $10k budget → Learn → Day ends
Episode 2: Fresh $10k → Keep Q-tables → Continue learning
Episode 3: Fresh $10k → More learning → Patterns emerge
...
Episode 100: Agent has discovered optimal strategies!
```

## How Audience Targeting Works

The agent uses **platform targeting APIs**, not individual tracking:

### Facebook/Meta
```python
'parents_35_45' → Age: 35-44 + Interests: Parenting
'teens_16_19' → Age: 16-19 + Interests: Mental Health
```

### Google Search
```python
'parents_35_45' → Keywords: "teen anxiety help" + Parents affinity
'teachers' → Keywords: "student mental health" + Education affinity
```

### TikTok
```python
'teens_16_19' → #MentalHealthAwareness + Age targeting
'parents_35_45' → #ParentingTeens + Lookalike audiences
```

## Discovery Process

1. **Random Exploration (30%)**
   - Tries different audience/channel/message combos
   - Gets rewards based on CVR

2. **Q-Table Learning**
   - Records which combinations get high rewards
   - Updates values based on results

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - After 100+ episodes, patterns emerge
   - Agent discovers parents_35_45 + Google = 4.5% CVR

4. **Exploitation (70%)**
   - Uses discovered winning combinations
   - Continues refining strategy

## Expected Timeline

- **Episodes 1-10:** Random exploration, low performance
- **Episodes 10-50:** Starting to find patterns
- **Episodes 50-100:** Clear winners emerge
- **Episodes 100+:** Optimized strategy, 10-15x CVR improvement
