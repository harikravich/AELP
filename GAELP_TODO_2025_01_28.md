# GAELP COMPREHENSIVE TODO LIST
Last Updated: January 28, 2025

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 1. Fix Continuous Learning Loop
**Problem:** Simulation stops at $10k budget limit, learning doesn't persist
- [ ] Modify environment to reset budget but keep Q-tables
- [ ] Fix episode counting (currently always 0)
- [ ] Update learning metrics from real RL agent
- [ ] Ensure epsilon decay works properly
- [ ] Store Q-tables in Redis for persistence

### 2. Implement Realistic Attribution
**Problem:** Using fantasy multi-touch attribution we can't actually track
- [ ] Implement last-click attribution ONLY
- [ ] Remove all multi-touch fantasy code
- [ ] Connect to conversion pixel tracking
- [ ] Map click_ids to conversions properly
- [ ] Update attribution display in dashboard

### 3. Fix Balance Campaign Strategy  
**Problem:** Wrong targeting causing 0.32% CVR
- [ ] Change targeting from parents 50+ to parents 35-45
- [ ] Update messaging from "parenting pressure" to teen mental health
- [ ] Focus on iOS users (Balance limitation)
- [ ] Create proper behavioral health creatives
- [ ] Test suicide prevention messaging (6.2% CVR potential)

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY (Jan 28)

### Dashboard Component Integration
- [x] Connected UserJourneyDatabase through MasterOrchestrator

- [x] Fixed unrealistic 75-81% CTRs (now 0.1-10%)
- [x] Added FTC/FDA compliance for health claims
- [x] Connected to GA4 via MCP tools
- [x] Discovered Balance campaign issues

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### Storage Systems
- [ ] Verify BigQuery writes for journey storage
- [ ] Implement Redis for Q-table persistence

## üìã PENDING TASKS

### Data Realism Audit
- [ ] Remove ALL competitor bid visibility
- [ ] Remove cross-site user tracking
- [ ] Implement platform-level targeting only
- [ ] Ensure only trackable data is used
- [ ] Audit all simulation data sources

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run 100+ episode test with continuous learning
- [ ] Verify all 19 components working together
- [ ] Check for any remaining fallbacks
- [ ] Validate realistic data constraints
- [ ] Test Balance campaign optimization

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize simulation speed
- [ ] Reduce memory usage
- [ ] Implement batch processing
- [ ] Add parallel simulations
- [ ] Profile and optimize bottlenecks

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

### NEVER DO:
- ‚ùå Use fallbacks or simplifications
- ‚ùå Implement bandits instead of RL
- ‚ùå Track data we wouldn't have in real life
- ‚ùå Show competitor bids or cross-site journeys
- ‚ùå Call Balance "parental controls"

### ALWAYS DO:
- ‚úÖ Use proper Q-learning/PPO for RL
- ‚úÖ Only track last-click attribution
- ‚úÖ Focus on teen behavioral health
- ‚úÖ Target parents 35-45
- ‚úÖ Be brutally honest about what works

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

### Current State:
- Balance CVR: 0.32% (FAILING)
- Win Rate: Variable
- CTR Model: 0.827 AUC
- Episodes Run: 0 (BROKEN)
- Segments Discovered: 0 (needs 50+ episodes)

### Target State:
- Balance CVR: 2-4% (behavioral health positioning)
- Win Rate: 20-30% (competitive bidding)
- Continuous Learning: 1000+ episodes
- Discovered Segments: 10+ high-value patterns
- ROAS: 3.0+ (with proper targeting)

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT

1. **Episode Management** - Currently broken, stops at budget
2. **Q-table Persistence** - Not saving between sessions
3. **Attribution Window** - Need proper 30-day implementation
4. **Competitive Bidding** - Still winning too many auctions
5. **Creative Testing** - Need more behavioral health variants

## üìù NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

- Dashboard connected to all 19 components via MasterOrchestrator
- Using @property accessors for real component data
- Fake tracking dicts identified and being replaced
- Balance is BEHAVIORAL HEALTH for TEENS (not parental controls!)
- RL agent should DISCOVER how to sell, not avoid product
- User demands brutal honesty and hates simplifications
- Sourcegraph: https://gaelp.sourcegraph.app
- GA4 Property: 308028264 (Aura - Balance)

## üé¨ NEXT STEPS

1. **Test Full Integration**
   ```bash
   python3 gaelp_live_dashboard_enhanced.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Real Components**
   - Check journey_db writes

   - Watch Q-table growth
   - Track segment discovery

3. **Fix Continuous Learning**
   - Modify environment reset

   - Fix episode counting

4. **Optimize Balance Campaign**
   - New targeting parameters
   - Behavioral health messaging
   - iOS-specific optimization
