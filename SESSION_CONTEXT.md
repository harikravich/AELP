# GAELP Session Context - Continue From Here

## Session Date: 2025-08-21

## What We Were Doing
Building GAELP (Generic Agent Experimentation & Learning Platform) - an AI system that learns to optimize ad campaigns using reinforcement learning.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Built complete architecture with 13 sub-agents
- ‚úÖ Implemented real PyTorch neural networks (PPO, SAC, DQN)
- ‚úÖ Created visualization and learning analysis tools
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Discovered most infrastructure is MOCKED (not connected to real services)
- üîß Started wiring up real connections

## Key Discovery
**The agent currently DOES NOT remember learning between runs!** Each execution starts fresh. We were fixing this by:
1. Implementing checkpoint loading
2. Connecting to GCP services
3. Adding real data persistence

## Infrastructure Reality Check Results
- 4.2% Real/Working (just PyTorch neural networks)
- 33.3% Mock/Local (works locally but not connected)
- 62.5% Not Connected (shells and interfaces only)

## What Works
- Real neural networks with learning algorithms
- Local file outputs (charts, JSON)
- Visualization tools
- Learning analysis

## What Needs Connection
1. **GCP BigQuery** - For data persistence
2. **Cloud Storage** - For model checkpoints
3. **Redis** - For state management
4. **Google Ads API** - For real campaign data
5. **OpenAI/Claude API** - For realistic user simulation
6. **Pub/Sub** - For event streaming

## Files Created This Session
- `/home/hariravichandran/AELP/checkpoint_manager.py` - Enables learning persistence
- `/home/hariravichandran/AELP/infrastructure_reality_check.py` - Analyzes what's real vs mock
- `/home/hariravichandran/AELP/analyze_rl_learnings.py` - Shows what agent learned
- `/home/hariravichandran/AELP/setup_after_restart.sh` - Continue setup after VM restart

## Commands to Run After Restart

### 1. Check new GCP permissions work:
```bash
gcloud services list --enabled --format="value(config.name)" | grep -E "bigquery|storage"
```

### 2. Enable required APIs:
```bash
gcloud services enable \
  bigquery.googleapis.com \
  storage.googleapis.com \
  pubsub.googleapis.com \
  aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

### 3. Create BigQuery dataset:
```bash
bq mk --dataset --location=us-central1 aura-thrive-platform:gaelp_training
```

### 4. Create Cloud Storage bucket:
```bash
gsutil mb -l us-central1 gs://gaelp-model-checkpoints-${USER}
```

### 5. Test the learning persistence:
```bash
cd /home/hariravichandran/AELP
python3 run_real_rl_demo.py  # Run once, it learns
python3 run_real_rl_demo.py  # Run again, should continue from previous learning!
```

## Environment Variables Needed
Create `/home/hariravichandran/AELP/.env`:
```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=aura-thrive-platform
BIGQUERY_DATASET=gaelp_training
GCS_BUCKET=gaelp-model-checkpoints-xxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # If you have one
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # Or Claude API
```

## Next Steps Priority
1. **CRITICAL**: Wire up checkpoint loading so agent remembers learning
2. Connect BigQuery for data persistence  
3. Add LLM API for realistic personas
4. Connect Google Ads API for real data
5. Set up monitoring dashboards

## How to Continue
When you reconnect after restart, share this context file with Claude:
"I was working on GAELP and need to continue. Here's the context from SESSION_CONTEXT.md"

Then Claude can continue exactly where we left off!

## Important Code Sections We Modified
- `training_orchestrator/core.py` - Added checkpoint manager
- `training_orchestrator/checkpoint_manager.py` - New file for persistence
- Various RL agent files to fix numpy issues

## Questions We Were Addressing
1. "Is the full pipeline on GCP rigged up?" - NO, mostly mocked
2. "Does it remember its history?" - NO, but we're fixing this
3. "What's still fake?" - Most external connections (see infrastructure_reality_check.py output)

## Your GCP Project Info
- Project: aura-thrive-platform
- VM: thrive-backend
- Zone: us-central1-a
- Service Account: 556751870393-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com

## Command That Triggered VM Restart Need
```bash
gcloud compute instances set-service-account thrive-backend \
  --service-account=556751870393-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \
  --zone=us-central1-a
```

This requires VM to be stopped first, which will end our session.
