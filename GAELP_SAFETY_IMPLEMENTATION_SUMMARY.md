## 🔧 INTEGRATION WITH GAELP

### Decorator Integration
```python
@gaelp_safety_decorator("bidding")
def place_bid(bid_data):
    # Safety validation happens automatically
    return execute_bid(bid_data)

@reward_validation_decorator  
def calculate_reward(state):
    # Reward validation and clipping automatic
    return compute_reward(state)
```

### Direct API Integration
```python
# Comprehensive safety validation
safety_result = validate_gaelp_safety(bid_data)

if safety_result.overall_result == SafetyCheckResult.APPROVED:
    # Safe to proceed
    execute_bid(bid_data)
elif safety_result.overall_result == SafetyCheckResult.CONDITIONAL:
    # Apply safe modifications
    execute_bid_with_modifications(bid_data, safety_result.safe_modifications)
else:
    # Block or send for human review
    handle_safety_violation(safety_result)
```

### Training Integration
```python
# Automatic safety validation in training loop
is_safe, modifications = orchestrator.validate_training_step(training_data)
if is_safe:
    continue_training(training_data, modifications)
