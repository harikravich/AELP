# GAELP Agent Manager - System Overview

## What We Built

The Agent Manager is a comprehensive system for managing AI agents in the GAELP platform. It provides complete lifecycle management from agent registration to training execution.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Data Models (`/core/models.py`)
- **Agent**: Represents an AI agent with configuration, resources, and budget
- **TrainingJob**: Represents a training job with status, priority, and resource allocation
- **AgentDeployment**: Represents a deployed agent instance
- **ResourceQuota**: Manages user resource quotas
- **AgentMetrics**: Stores performance and resource usage metrics

### 2. Business Logic Services (`/core/services.py`)
- **AgentService**: CRUD operations for agents
- **TrainingJobService**: Job management and lifecycle
- **ResourceService**: Quota management and resource allocation
- **MetricsService**: Metrics collection and retrieval

### 3. Kubernetes Integration (`/kubernetes/`)
- **KubernetesClient**: Direct Kubernetes API integration
- **JobScheduler**: Intelligent job scheduling with resource management
- **AutoScaler**: Dynamic scaling based on demand

### 4. REST API (`/api/`)
- **FastAPI Application**: RESTful API with authentication
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time monitoring
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication

### 5. Monitoring (`/monitoring/`)
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics collection
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks and alerting
- **WebSocket Manager**: Real-time data streaming

### 6. Configuration (`/config/`)
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Flexible settings management
- **Production-ready Defaults**: Secure configuration templates

## Key Features

### 1. Agent Registration & Deployment
```python
# Register a new agent
agent = {
    "name": "campaign-optimizer-v2",
    "type": "real_deployment",
    "docker_image": "gcr.io/gaelp/optimizer:v2.0",
    "resource_requirements": {
        "cpu": "4",
        "memory": "8Gi",
        "gpu": "1"
    },
    "budget_limit": 5000.0
}
```

### 2. Job Scheduling
- Priority-based scheduling (1-10 scale)
- Resource-aware allocation
- Queue management with overflow handling
- Automatic retry and failure recovery

### 3. Resource Management
- Per-user quotas (CPU, Memory, GPU, Storage)
- Budget tracking and enforcement
- Cost optimization with preemptible instances
- Resource utilization monitoring

### 4. Real-time Monitoring
```javascript
// WebSocket connection for real-time metrics
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/1');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const metrics = JSON.parse(event.data);
    updateDashboard(metrics);
};
```

### 5. Multi-Agent Coordination
- Parallel training across multiple agents
- Experiment management and comparison
- Resource sharing and optimization
- Campaign competition and collaboration

## Production Deployment

### Architecture
```
Internet → Load Balancer → Kubernetes Ingress

                          Agent Manager API (3 replicas)
                              ↓
                        ┌─────┼─────┐
                        ↓     ↓     ↓
                   PostgreSQL Redis Prometheus
```

### Scaling
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for API pods
- Cluster autoscaler for Kubernetes nodes
- Resource quotas prevent resource exhaustion
- Load balancing for high availability

### Security
- JWT-based authentication
- RBAC in Kubernetes
- Secret management via Kubernetes secrets
- Network policies for isolation

## Integration Points

### Training Orchestrator
- Job execution coordination
- Model checkpointing
- Result aggregation and storage

### Safety & Policy Engine
- Budget limit enforcement
- Safety policy validation
- Compliance monitoring and reporting

### Benchmark Portal
- Performance result display
- Historical tracking and comparison
- Leaderboard and competition features

## Usage Examples

### Create and Train an Agent
```bash
# 1. Create agent
curl -X POST /api/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d @agent-config.json

# 2. Start training job
curl -X POST /api/v1/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d @job-config.json

# 3. Monitor progress
curl /api/v1/agents/1/metrics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Monitor System Health
```bash
# System status
curl /api/v1/status -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Prometheus metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput
- 50+ concurrent training jobs
- 1000+ API requests per second
- Real-time metric updates (sub-second latency)

### Scalability
