# GAELP UserJourneyDatabase System

## üéØ Overview

The GAELP UserJourneyDatabase system is a comprehensive multi-touch attribution and user journey tracking platform that maintains persistent user state across episodes. This is CRITICAL for the RL system to learn from multi-touch journeys, as users do NOT reset between episodes.

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Journey Tracking

```python
from user_journey_database import UserJourneyDatabase
from journey_state import TransitionTrigger

# Initialize database
db = UserJourneyDatabase(project_id="your-project")

# Get or create journey
journey, is_new = db.get_or_create_journey(
    user_id="user123",
    channel="google_ads",
    interaction_type="click"
)

# Update with new touchpoint
updated_journey = db.update_journey(
    journey_id=journey.journey_id,
    touchpoint=touchpoint,
    trigger=TransitionTrigger.CLICK
)
```

### RL Agent Integration

```python
from journey_aware_rl_agent import DatabaseIntegratedRLAgent

# Initialize RL agent with database
agent = DatabaseIntegratedRLAgent(
    bigquery_project_id="your-project"
)

# Process user interaction and get recommendation
recommendation, expected_reward = agent.process_user_interaction(
    user_id="user123",
    channel="google_ads", 
    interaction_type="click",
    dwell_time_seconds=45.0,
    scroll_depth=0.6
)

# Record conversion
agent.record_conversion(
    user_id="user123",
