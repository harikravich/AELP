# DeepMind Features Status Check

## Current Implementation Status of 4 Key DeepMind Features

### 1. ❌ **Self-Play** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Search Results**: 0 matches for self-play patterns

You don't have agents competing against evolved versions of themselves. This is a CRITICAL missing piece for discovering non-obvious strategies.

**What's needed:**
```python
class MarketingSelfPlay:
    def train(self):
        # Current agent plays against past versions
        # Evolves strategies through competition
```

### 2. ✅/⚠️ **Monte Carlo** - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Search Results**: 30+ matches, multiple files

You HAVE Monte Carlo simulation but NOT Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):

**What you have:**
- ✅ `MonteCarloSimulator` class with 100+ parallel worlds
- ✅ Parallel simulation across different scenarios
- ✅ Integration with training orchestrator
- ✅ Different world types (normal, high value, crisis, competitor-heavy)

**What's MISSING:**
- ❌ **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)** - For planning campaign sequences
- ❌ Tree-based exploration of decision space
- ❌ UCT (Upper Confidence Trees) for balancing exploration/exploitation

The Monte Carlo you have is for parallel simulation, NOT for strategic planning like AlphaGo uses.

### 3. ❌ **World Model** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Search Results**: 0 matches for world model patterns

You don't have a learned model of the environment for planning:

**What's needed:**
```python
class WorldModel:
    def predict_next_state(self, state, action):
        # Predict what happens next
    
    def imagine_rollout(self, initial_state, policy):
        # Mental simulation without real environment
```

This is CRITICAL for planning without expensive real simulations.

### 4. ✅ **Curriculum Learning** - IMPLEMENTED
**Search Results**: 30+ matches in curriculum.py

You HAVE comprehensive curriculum learning:

**What you have:**
- ✅ `CurriculumScheduler` class
- ✅ Progressive difficulty tasks
- ✅ 4 phases: Simulation → Historical → Real Testing → Scaled Deployment
- ✅ Adaptive difficulty progression
- ✅ Performance-based advancement

**Implementation details:**
```python
# From your code:
- Phase 1: Simulation Training Curriculum
- Phase 2: Historical Validation Curriculum  
- Phase 3: Real Testing Curriculum
- Phase 4: Scaled Deployment Curriculum
```

## Summary: 1.5 out of 4 DeepMind Features

| Feature | Status | What You Have | What's Missing |
|---------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Self-Play** | ❌ | Nothing | Agent vs agent competition |
| **Monte Carlo** | ⚠️ | Parallel simulation | MCTS for planning |
| **World Model** | ❌ | Nothing | Learned environment dynamics |
| **Curriculum** | ✅ | Full implementation | Nothing - this is complete |

## Critical Missing Pieces for DeepMind-Level Performance

### 1. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (NOT just simulation)**
You have parallel worlds but not tree search for planning:

```python
# What you need to ADD:
class CampaignMCTS:
    """Plan entire 30-day campaign sequences"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.tree = {}
        
    def search(self, root_state, n_simulations=10000):
        for _ in range(n_simulations):
            # Selection: Choose promising path
            leaf = self.select(root_state)
            
            # Expansion: Add new node
            child = self.expand(leaf)
            
            # Simulation: Random rollout
            reward = self.simulate(child)
            
            # Backpropagation: Update tree
            self.backpropagate(child, reward)
        
        return self.best_action(root_state)
```

### 2. **World Model for Mental Simulation**
Learn environment dynamics for planning without real simulation:

```python
# What you need to ADD:
class LearnedWorldModel:
    """Predict future without expensive simulation"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.dynamics_model = TransformerModel()
        
    def imagine_campaign(self, initial_state, policy, horizon=30):
        """Imagine 30-day campaign without running simulator"""
        states = [initial_state]
        
        for day in range(horizon):
            action = policy(states[-1])
            next_state = self.dynamics_model.predict(states[-1], action)
            states.append(next_state)
            
        return states
```

### 3. **Self-Play for Strategy Evolution**
Discover non-obvious strategies through competition:

```python
# What you need to ADD:
class SelfPlayTrainer:
    """Like AlphaGo - compete against yourself"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent_pool = []  # Past versions
        
    def train_generation(self):
        current = self.agent.clone()
        
        # Play against pool of past agents
        for opponent in self.agent_pool:
            winner = self.compete(current, opponent)
            current.learn_from_game(winner)
        
        # Add to pool if better
        if current.performance > self.agent.performance:
            self.agent_pool.append(current)
            self.agent = current
```

## The Bottom Line

You have **strong foundations** with Monte Carlo simulation and Curriculum Learning, but you're missing the **strategic planning layer** that makes DeepMind systems superhuman:

1. ✅ You can simulate many scenarios (Monte Carlo)
2. ✅ You can progressively learn (Curriculum)
3. ❌ You CAN'T plan strategically (No MCTS)
4. ❌ You CAN'T imagine futures (No World Model)
5. ❌ You CAN'T evolve strategies (No Self-Play)

**To reach DeepMind-level performance, you need to add:**
- MCTS for campaign planning
- World Model for imagination
- Self-Play for strategy discovery

These aren't nice-to-haves - they're what separate good systems from superhuman ones.
