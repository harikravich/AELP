# Behavioral Health Marketing Simulator - What Demis Would Build

## THE TRUTH: Your Current System vs What's Needed

### Current Reality (What's Running Now)
```python
# This is what you have:
segment = random.choice(['crisis_parent', 'researcher'])  # WRONG
click_prob = 0.08  # WRONG - not crisis-driven
conversion = instant_decision()  # WRONG - takes weeks
```

### What Demis Would Build
```python
# Multi-week crisis-driven journey
parent = PersonaFactory.create_crisis_parent(
    trigger_event="found_self_harm_content",
    urgency_level=9/10,
    research_phase_days=3-7,
    comparison_set=['Aura', 'Bark', 'Qustodio'],
    decision_factors=['clinical_backing', 'sleep_monitoring', 'crisis_alerts']
)
```

## 1. SOPHISTICATED WORLD MODEL (Currently BROKEN)

### What Exists but ISN'T Connected:
- **PersonaFactory** (`persona_factory.py`) - BUILT, NOT USED
- **LLM Service** (`llm_persona_service.py`) - BUILT, NOT USED  
- **Journey Database** (`user_journey_database.py`) - BUILT, NOT USED
- **Criteo Data** (45M impressions) - LOADED, NOT USED

### The Parent Journey You're NOT Modeling:

#### Week 1: Crisis Event
- Kid found on self-harm forums at 3am
- Parent discovers concerning Discord messages
- Immediate Google: "how to monitor teen mental health online"

#### Week 2: Research Phase  
- Reads 20+ articles on teen digital wellness
- Joins 3 parent Facebook groups
- Compares 5 apps (Aura, Bark, Qustodio, Circle, ScreenTime)
- Watches YouTube reviews

#### Week 3: Trial Phase
- Signs up for 2-3 free trials
- Tests sleep monitoring features
- Checks if it detects concerning content
- Shows spouse, debates privacy vs safety

#### Week 4: Purchase Decision
- Triggered by: Another incident OR payday OR therapist recommendation
- Chooses based on: Clinical credibility + comprehensive monitoring

## 2. RL AGENT (Working but Learning WRONG Patterns)

### What's Working:
- Q-learning/PPO implementation ✅
- RecSim integration ✅  
- AuctionGym mechanics ✅

### What's WRONG:
- Learning from single-touch conversions (not multi-week)
- No crisis urgency modeling
- Not learning: crisis_event → research_intensity → conversion_probability

## 3. CONTENT/ADS/CHANNELS (Generic, Not Behavioral Health)

### What You Need:

#### Crisis-Triggered Ads:
```
"Is your teen okay? 87% of parents miss digital warning signs"
"Clinician-designed monitoring for teen mental health"
"Know when they're struggling - before it's too late"
```

#### Channel Strategy by Journey Stage:
- **Crisis moment**: Google Search (high intent)
- **Research phase**: Facebook parent groups, YouTube
- **Comparison**: Review sites, Reddit
- **Retargeting**: Emphasize clinical backing, sleep insights

## YOUR GOOGLE ANALYTICS DATA

You mentioned years of Aura data. You need to extract:
1. **Multi-touch attribution paths** for parental control conversions
2. **Time lag** between first touch and conversion (bet it's 7-21 days)
3. **Content consumption** patterns (which features pages → conversion)
4. **Crisis indicators** in search terms

## WHAT NEEDS TO BE WIRED TOGETHER

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Replace hardcoded segments with PersonaFactory**
```python
# INSTEAD OF:
segment = 'crisis_parent'  # hardcoded

# USE:
parent = PersonaFactory.create_parent_from_crisis_trigger(
    trigger_type=discovered_from_search_terms(ga_data)
)
```

2. **Connect Criteo for realistic CTR**
```python
# INSTEAD OF:
ctr = 0.02  # hardcoded

# USE:
ctr = criteo_model.predict_ctr(
    ad_content=behavioral_health_focused,
    user_state=parent.crisis_urgency
)
```

3. **Model multi-week journeys**
```python
# INSTEAD OF:
def step():
    return instant_conversion()

# USE:
def journey_step(day, parent_state):
    if day < 3 and parent_state.crisis_level > 7:
        return 'emergency_research'
    elif day < 14:
        return 'comparison_shopping'
    # etc...
```

## THE HARD TRUTH

Your system has all the pieces but they're not talking:
- PersonaFactory exists → but simulator uses hardcoded segments
- LLM Service exists → but not generating realistic crisis parents
- Journey tracking exists → but not modeling multi-week decisions
- Criteo data exists → but not calibrating behavior

**You built a Ferrari engine but put it in a 1990 Honda Civic body.**

## What Would Demis Do?

1. **Start with the hardest problem**: Multi-week crisis-driven journeys
2. **Use ALL available data**: GA + Criteo + real parent psychology
3. **No shortcuts**: Model actual sleep disruption → parent panic → research → purchase
4. **Learn from reality**: Connect to real GA data, not fake segments

The system should simulate a parent who discovers their kid searching "how to kill myself" at 2am and then models their ACTUAL 2-week journey to buying Aura, including all the comparison shopping, spouse discussions, and therapist consultations.

**That's what you're not doing.**
