# GA4 Access with OKTA SSO - The Real Solution

## The Problem
- Aura uses OKTA for SSO (Single Sign-On)
- hari@aura.com is an OKTA-managed account
- Regular OAuth2 flow won't work with OKTA SSO
- Google's test OAuth client is blocked
- Compute service account doesn't have GA4 access

## Why OAuth is Failing
When you try to authenticate with hari@aura.com, Google redirects to OKTA for authentication. The OAuth flow breaks because:
1. OKTA handles the authentication
2. Google OAuth expects direct Google credentials
3. The redirect chain gets broken

## The PROPER Solutions

### Option 1: Service Account (BEST)
This is why JR created the service account! Service accounts bypass OKTA entirely.

**Action Required**: Ask Jason to add this to GA4:
```
Service Account: ga4-mcp-server@centering-line-469716-r7.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Role: Viewer
Location: GA4 Admin → Property Access Management
```

This works because:
- Service accounts don't use OKTA
- Direct API access with JSON key
- Already configured and ready

### Option 2: Use GA4 Export to BigQuery
If Aura has GA4 → BigQuery export enabled:
1. Access BigQuery with service account
2. Query GA4 data from BigQuery tables
3. No GA4 API needed

### Option 3: Use Google Analytics UI Export
1. Log into GA4 via browser (through OKTA)
2. Export data manually as CSV
3. Load into our system for calibration

### Option 4: Measurement Protocol
If you have a Measurement Protocol API secret:
1. Use Measurement Protocol to send test data
2. Read it back via BigQuery or exports

## Why OKTA Breaks OAuth
```
Normal OAuth:
User → Google OAuth → Google Account → GA4 Access ✓

OKTA SSO:
User → Google OAuth → OKTA Redirect → OKTA Login → 
  → SAML Assertion → Google → GA4 Access ✗ (breaks at OKTA redirect)
```

## The Reality
Since Aura uses OKTA SSO:
- Direct OAuth with hari@aura.com won't work
- Service account is the ONLY programmatic solution
- This is WHY they created the service account for you

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Message Jason to add service account to GA4
2. **While waiting**: Work on other tasks (auction fix, landing page)
3. **Alternative**: Check if BigQuery export is available

## NO FALLBACKS
- We will NOT use mock data
- We will NOT simplify
- We WILL get real GA4 data via service account
