   - Agent will discover: "parents_35_45" (4.5% CVR)
   - Also discover: "teens_16_19" direct targeting (1.5% CVR)

2. CHANNEL OPTIMIZATION:
   - Current: 86% Facebook (poor performance)
   - Agent will discover: Google Search for high intent (6.2% CVR)
   - Also discover: TikTok for teen empowerment (1.2% CVR)

3. MESSAGE REFINEMENT:
   - Current: "parenting pressure" (negative framing)
   - Agent will discover: "suicide prevention" (6.2% CVR urgency)
   - Also discover: "mental health" support (4.5% CVR)

4. CREATIVE & LANDING:
   - Video creative: 1.3x multiplier
   - Clinical backing landing: 1.25x multiplier
   - Combined effect: 1.625x CVR boost

PREDICTED OUTCOME:
- Starting CVR: 0.32%
- Discovered optimal: 4-6% CVR
- Improvement: 12-18X

The reward system is PROPERLY ALIGNED to discover these solutions!
