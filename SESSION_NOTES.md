# GAELP Platform Development - Session Notes

## Session Summary
- Successfully read and analyzed the GAELP Product Requirements Document
- Created comprehensive sub-agent architecture using Claude Code's /agents system
- Built 13 specialized sub-agents for different platform components
- Established project coordination and execution framework

## Key Accomplishments
1. **PDF Analysis**: Read 46.3KB GAELP PRD detailing the Generic Agent Experimentation & Learning Platform
2. **MCP Setup**: Fixed filesystem MCP server for local file access
3. **Sub-Agent Architecture**: Created 13 specialized agents in .claude/agents/ directory
4. **Project Planning**: Established phased development approach with clear coordination

## Sub-Agents Created
- Infrastructure: @gcp-infrastructure, @devops-coordinator, @bigquery-storage
- Core Services: @api-designer, @environment-registry, @agent-manager, @training-orchestrator  
- Safety & Quality: @safety-policy, @testing-validation
- User Experience: @benchmark-portal, @mcp-integration, @documentation
- Management: @project-coordinator

## GAELP Platform Vision
Building an "ALE for general AI" - a platform where agents can:
- Train across diverse environments (games, robotics, text, productivity)
- Learn through standardized interfaces
- Be evaluated fairly and reproducibly
- Operate under safety and ethical constraints
- Scale on GCP infrastructure

## Next Steps Ready
- Project coordinator can orchestrate the complete build
- Individual agents can work on specialized components
- Phased approach: Foundations → Core Services → Integration → User Experience

## Files Created
- 13 agent markdown files in .claude/agents/
- AGENTS_OVERVIEW.md with complete architecture documentation
- All agents configured with proper tools and system prompts
## Current Status: Ready to Begin Development

**Architecture Complete**: 13 specialized sub-agents created and configured
**Next Phase**: Ready to begin Phase 0 development with @project-coordinator

## Immediate Next Steps:
1. Invoke @project-coordinator to begin Phase 0
2. Start with infrastructure setup via @gcp-infrastructure  
3. Define APIs with @api-designer
4. Establish DevOps workflows with @devops-coordinator

## Agent Readiness:
✅ All 13 agents created in .claude/agents/
✅ Project coordination framework established
✅ Phase-based development plan defined
✅ Integration points mapped between agents

Ready to build the future of AI agent research!
