üî• Balance has a GREAT product for a HUGE market need:
   - Teen mental health crisis is real
   - Parents would pay $75/month to help their teen
   - Teens desperately need these tools

üò≠ But the marketing is COMPLETELY WRONG:
   - Wrong audience (parents vs teens)
   - Wrong message (pressure vs support)
   - Wrong channels (Facebook vs TikTok)
   - Wrong framing (control vs care)

üí° With proper marketing, Balance could have:
   - 2-4% CVR (like competitors)
   - 10x current revenue
   - Actual impact on teen mental health

The marketing team needs to:
1. Understand the product (behavioral health, not parental control)
2. Understand the audience (teens, not parents over 50)
3. Use the right channels (where teens are)
4. Communicate the value (mental health support)
5. Test creative that resonates with teens

Current 0.32% CVR ‚Üí Potential 3%+ CVR = 10X IMPROVEMENT
