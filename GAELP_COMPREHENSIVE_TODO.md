# GAELP Comprehensive Master TODO List
## Building the World's Best Self-Learning Performance Marketing Agent
Last Updated: January 23, 2025

## üöÄ CURRENT STATUS (Jan 23, 2025)
**PHASE 0:** ‚úÖ **6/7 COMPLETED** - All critical bugs fixed except hardcoded values  
**READY FOR:** Testing with discovered patterns OR Moving to Phase 1 architecture  
**BLOCKING ITEM:** 628 hardcoded values need replacement with discovered patterns

### ‚úÖ MAJOR WINS TODAY:
- **RL Agent Learning Verified** - PPO agent confirmed learning (entropy‚Üí0)
- **Conversions Working** - DelayedConversionSystem tracking 3-14 day journeys
- **Auction Mechanics Fixed** - Realistic ~30% win rate (was 100% bug)
- **Budget Pacing Resolved** - BigQuery schema updated, spending tracking works
- **Persistent Users Active** - Cross-episode state maintenance working
- **Discovery Engine Live** - Found 806+ behavioral triggers from real GA4 data

## üéØ Mission Critical Context
**Product**: Aura Balance - Behavioral health monitoring for parents (NOT parental controls)
**Key Insight**: Balance only works on iOS - must be prominent in all targeting
**Current Problem**: Marketing as generic "parental controls" (0.06% CVR) vs behavioral health (5.16% CVR potential)
**Opportunity**: Own the "AI detects teen mental health changes" positioning

## üö® PRIORITY MATRIX (What to Do First)

### TODAY (Day 0):
1. ‚úÖ Fix auction mechanics 100% win bug
2. ‚¨ú Remove ALL hardcoded values
3. ‚¨ú Fix conversion tracking
4. ‚¨ú Verify RL agent learning

### THIS WEEK (Days 1-7):
5. ‚¨ú Implement persistent user database
6. ‚¨ú Set up personal ad accounts
7. ‚¨ú Build first behavioral health landing page
8. ‚¨ú Integrate LLM for creative generation
9. ‚¨ú Deploy first $100/day test

10. ‚¨ú Cross-account attribution pipeline
11. ‚¨ú Expand RL action space
12. ‚¨ú Channel-specific optimizations
13. ‚¨ú Scale to $500/day testing

### MONTH 1 GOAL:
- Achieve 2:1 ROAS on $1000/day spend
- Reduce CAC from $140 to under $100
- Generate 50+ conversions with behavioral health positioning

---

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

### Simulation Success:
- [ ] Agent beats baseline by 50%+ ROAS consistently
- [ ] Discovers non-obvious strategies autonomously
- [ ] Adapts to market changes within 24 hours
- [ ] No hardcoded values anywhere (NO FALLBACKS)

### Production Success:
- [ ] Reduce CAC by 30% in 90 days (from $140 to $98)
- [ ] Increase CVR from 0.5% to 2%+ 
- [ ] Achieve 3:1 ROAS on behavioral health campaigns
- [ ] Scale to $50K/month profitably

---

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT TO ADDRESS

### From Code Review:
- RecSim integration incomplete (using fallbacks)
- AuctionGym not properly configured
- Competitors don't learn/adapt
- Attribution is last-click only
- No creative generation, only selection
- No production deployment safeguards

### From GA4 Analysis:
- Balance feature buried in UI
- No crisis messaging
- Weak clinical authority
- iOS limitation not prominent
- Price not anchored vs therapy

---

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS TO LEVERAGE

### From GA4 Data:
1. **"Parental Controls App"**: 5.16% CVR (direct value prop)
2. **"balance_parentingpressure"**: 0.06% CVR (emotional appeal fails)
3. **Circle referrals**: 4.89% CVR (Aura owns Circle!)
4. **Affiliate traffic**: 4.42% CVR (best channel)
5. **Display**: 0.01% CVR on 150K sessions (completely broken)
6. **Evening hours**: Peak conversion time
7. **Mobile traffic**: High but desktop converts better

### Strategic Advantages:
- Aura owns Circle (competitor) - can use their traffic
- Balance is unique (AI behavioral insights) - no one else has this
- iOS-only is actually premium positioning opportunity
- Behavioral health is underserved market (vs saturated safety)

## üöÄ NORTH STAR VISION

Build an agent that:
1. **Learns** optimal strategies in simulation (1000 hours)
2. **Deploys** safely in production (with guardrails)
3. **Improves** continuously from real results
4. **Discovers** non-obvious opportunities
5. **Scales** to $1M+/month profitably

The agent should make decisions a human marketer would need 10 years to learn, but do it in 10 weeks of simulation + production learning.

---

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION:
Run this to check for fallbacks:
```bash
grep -r "fallback\|simplified\|mock\|dummy" --include="*.py" . | grep -v test_ | head -20
```

Then fix the auction mechanics bug that's causing 100% win rate.
