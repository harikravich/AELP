   - Threshold: 120% of daily budget limit
   - Action: Immediate campaign pause and bidding halt
   - Escalation: BLACK level at 180% (full shutdown)

2. **Anomalous Bidding (>$50 CPC)**
   - Threshold: $50 maximum CPC
   - Action: Bid cap reduction by 50%
   - Escalation: BLACK level at $100 CPC (full shutdown)

3. **Training Instability (loss explosion)**
   - Threshold: 10x baseline loss
   - Action: Revert to last stable model
   - Escalation: BLACK level at 50x baseline (full shutdown)

4. **System Errors (>5 failures/minute)**
   - Threshold: 5 errors per minute
   - Action: Circuit breaker activation
   - Escalation: RED level automatic response

### ‚úÖ CIRCUIT BREAKERS FOR ALL COMPONENTS
