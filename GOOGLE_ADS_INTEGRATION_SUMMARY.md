```bash
# Run comprehensive integration tests
python test_google_ads_production_integration.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Campaign Creation
```python
from google_ads_production_manager import GoogleAdsProductionManager
import asyncio

async def create_campaign():
    # Initialize manager
    ads_manager = GoogleAdsProductionManager()
    
    # Create behavioral health campaign
    campaign_resource_name = await ads_manager.create_production_campaign()
    print(f"Campaign created: {campaign_resource_name}")

asyncio.run(create_campaign())
```

### RL-Driven Optimization
```python
from google_ads_gaelp_integration import GAELPGoogleAdsAgent
from google_ads_production_manager import GoogleAdsProductionManager
import asyncio

async def optimize_with_rl():
    # Initialize components
    ads_manager = GoogleAdsProductionManager()
    rl_agent = GAELPGoogleAdsAgent(ads_manager)
    
    # Create RL-managed campaign
    campaign_resource_name = await rl_agent.create_rl_campaign("behavioral_health")
    
    # Enable campaign
    campaign_id = campaign_resource_name.split('/')[-1]
    await ads_manager.enable_campaign(campaign_id)
    
    # Run optimization cycle
    await rl_agent.optimize_campaigns()

asyncio.run(optimize_with_rl())
```

### Continuous Optimization
```python
from gaelp_google_ads_bridge import integrate_google_ads_with_gaelp
import asyncio

async def run_continuous_optimization():
    # Initialize bridge
    bridge = await integrate_google_ads_with_gaelp()
    
    # Start continuous optimization
    await bridge.start_continuous_optimization()

asyncio.run(run_continuous_optimization())
```

## Integration with GAELP RL System

### State Representation
The integration uses `GAELPCampaignState` to represent campaign performance:
- Impressions, clicks, conversions
- Cost metrics and efficiency ratios
- Quality score estimates
- Keyword-level performance data
- Competitor pressure indicators

### Reward Function
The RL agent uses a multi-component reward function:
- Primary: Conversions per dollar spent
- Secondary: CTR and impression share bonuses
- Penalty: High cost without conversions

### Action Space
RL actions include:
- Bid adjustments (0.5x to 2.0x current bid)
- Keyword-level optimizations
- Budget reallocations
- Campaign pause/resume decisions

## Safety Systems

### 1. Emergency Controls
- **Spending Limits:** Automatic pause when daily spend exceeds thresholds
- **Performance Monitoring:** Zero conversion detection with automated response
- **Bid Limits:** Min/max bid enforcement ($0.50 - $50.00)

### 2. Rate Limiting
- API call frequency management
- Batch operation optimization
- Quota usage monitoring

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful API error recovery
- Campaign state persistence
- Rollback mechanisms for failed operations

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- **Campaign Level:** Impressions, clicks, conversions, cost, CTR, conversion rate
- **Keyword Level:** Individual keyword performance and bid efficiency
- **RL Performance:** Action history, reward accumulation, optimization success rate

### Reporting
- Real-time performance dashboards
- Historical trend analysis
- ROI and efficiency calculations
- Emergency situation alerts
