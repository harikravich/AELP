# GAELP Ad Campaign Agent - Coordination Plan

## Executive Summary
Building an AI agent that learns ad campaign optimization through simulation-to-real-world training. The agent progresses from simulated LLM personas to real Facebook/Google Ads with safety constraints and continuous improvement.

## Core Learning Loop Architecture
```
Simulate (LLM Personas) → Learn (Campaign Optimization) → Deploy (Real Ads) → Measure (Performance) → Improve (Feedback Loop)
```
