# GAELP Production Sprint - Session Summary
**Date:** September 1, 2025
**Session Duration:** ~3 hours
**Previous Status:** Day 1 Complete with RL training running

## üéØ Session Objectives
1. Continue GAELP production sprint from CRITICAL_NEXT_STEPS.md
2. Monitor parallel RL training (100,000 episodes target)
3. Extract and analyze GA4 data for real-world training
4. Understand Aura's complete product portfolio and conversion funnels

## üìä Critical Business Metrics Discovered

### Aura Product Portfolio
1. **Parental Controls (PC)** - ~59 sales/day, primary gateway product
2. **Antivirus (AV)** - 170-200 sales/day, volume driver
3. **Identity Protection** - Credit monitoring, privacy tools
4. **Balance/Thrive** - Behavioral health (small but growing, iOS only)
5. **Bundles** - Family, Couple, Individual packages

### August 2025 Daily Averages (Actual Business Metrics)
- **Web Trial Starts:** 298/day
- **App Trial Starts:** 236/day  
- **Total Trial Starts:** 534/day
- **Direct-to-Pay (D2P):** 861/day
- **Post-Trial Conversions:** 160/day (from trials 14 days prior)
- **Mobile App Subscribers:** 112/day
- **Total Paying Subscribers:** 1,134/day
- **Trial Conversion Rate:** 70% (after 14-day window)

### July 2025 Daily Averages (For Comparison)
- **Web Trial Starts:** 295/day

- **Total Paying Subscribers:** 1,101/day

## üîç GA4 Tracking Analysis

### What GA4 CAN Track
‚úÖ D2P purchases (immediate payment)
‚úÖ Post-trial conversions (when payment processes)
‚úÖ Revenue and transaction details
‚úÖ Device categories (60% mobile)
‚úÖ Campaign performance metrics
‚úÖ Landing page conversions

### What GA4 CANNOT Track
‚ùå Trial starts (not counted as purchases)
‚ùå App trial starts (236/day missing)
‚ùå Mobile app store subscriptions (112/day missing)
‚ùå Trial cohort attribution (which trial converts when)
‚ùå True trial-to-paid journey over 14 days

### GA4 vs Actual Mapping
- **GA4 shows:** ~960 "conversions"/day
- **Actually represents:** D2P + Post-trial conversions only
- **Missing:** All 534 trial starts/day
- **Gap:** ~174 conversions/day (mostly app-related)

## üí∞ Trial vs D2P Economics

### Funnel Types
1. **Free Trial (FT)**
   - Get credit card upfront
   - 14-day trial period
   - 70% convert to paid
   - Lower initial friction
   - Delayed revenue recognition

2. **Direct-to-Pay (D2P)**
   - Immediate payment
   - 100% "conversion"
   - Higher initial friction
   - Immediate revenue

### Bidding Implications
- **Trial Max Bid:** Target CPA √ó 0.70 (account for 30% non-conversion)
- **D2P Max Bid:** Target CPA √ó 0.95 (all convert immediately)
- **Bid Differential:** D2P can bid 1.36x more than trials

### Product Name Patterns
- **Trial Indicators:** "FT", "Free Trial", "14D Trial", "30d FT"
- **D2P Indicators:** "No DBOO", "direct-to-pay", "d2p", percentages without "FT"

## üöÄ Training Status

### Parallel RL Training
- **Target:** 100,000 episodes
- **Status:** Running on 16 cores (PID 10880)
- **Issue Found:** 0 auctions won after 20% completion
- **Root Cause:** Simulator bids too low ($0.50-$5 vs real CPCs of $20-50)
- **Fix Needed:** Adjust auction parameters to match real-world CPCs

### Data Extraction Progress
1. ‚úÖ Analyzed August week 1 campaign data
2. ‚úÖ Verified PC sales (~59/day matches user estimate)
3. ‚úÖ Identified trial vs D2P breakdown
4. ‚úÖ Mapped GA4 capabilities vs gaps
5. ‚è≥ Need to extract full 12 months for training

## üéØ Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Training Auction Parameters**
   - Increase bid ranges to $5-$50
   - Match real Google Ads CPCs
   - Ensure agent can actually win auctions

2. **Complete GA4 Extraction**
   - Pull 12 months of campaign data
   - Extract all product performance
   - Get creative/AB test results
   - Map user journey patterns

3. **Build Data Merger**
   - Combine GA4 data with internal metrics
   - Track trial cohorts properly
   - Create complete conversion attribution

4. **Adjust GAELP Training**
   - Use 70% trial conversion (not 30%)
   - Separate strategies for trial vs D2P
   - Incorporate real CPCs and competition levels
   - Add Balance/Thrive specific targeting (iOS only)

### Strategic Decisions Needed
1. Should we pause current training to fix auction parameters?
2. How to integrate internal app data with GA4?
3. Whether to train separate models per product or unified?
4. How to handle 14-day attribution window in RL training?

## üîë Key Insights

1. **PC is gateway product** but only 7% of volume - AV drives scale
2. **Trial conversion is 70%** not 30% - math error corrected
3. **GA4 missing 31% of data** - primarily app-related
4. **Mobile is 61% of business** - critical for Balance product
5. **Real CPCs are 10x higher** than simulator assumes
6. **Balance/Thrive opportunity** - small now but high CVR potential

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues

1. **Training Not Winning Auctions**
   - Bids too low for real competition
   - Need immediate parameter adjustment

2. **Incomplete Data Picture**
   - GA4 missing trial starts
   - App data not integrated
   - Attribution gaps

3. **Funnel Complexity**
   - Mix of trial and D2P
   - 14-day conversion windows
   - Multiple product lines

## üìù For Next Session

The next session should:
1. First check training progress: `ps aux | grep parallel_training`
2. Review this summary and TODO list
3. Fix auction parameters if still 0 wins
4. Complete GA4 data extraction
5. Build unified data pipeline
6. Restart training with real-world parameters
