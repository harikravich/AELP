# Winning Patterns (First Pass)

Scope: Meta (Aura cache as placeholder), proxies per success_config. Next pass will use competitors-only with Ad Library.

Top Hooks:
- Bank Text Panic — visceral “uh‑oh” + instant lock
- Breach Roulette — curiosity + exposure proof
- Pause Internet (Family) — humorous control moment

What to keep:
- Hook ≤3s, proof in ≤5s with real UI
- Captions high‑contrast; brand/claim visible early
- Voice: Earnest Parent UK; alternates Practical Advisor (US), Warm Mom (US)

Next: swap in competitor-only winners and re‑render 6–10 finals.
