## Component Implementation Analysis

### Fully Implemented Features:
1. **Data fetching and display** - All pages successfully fetch and display API data
2. **Real-time updates** - Approvals page auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
3. **Filtering** - Working filters on Approvals page
4. **API integrations** - Most read endpoints working
5. **Calculations** - CAC, ROAS, CTR, CVR calculations working
6. **Charts** - Revenue trends, channel mix visualizations working

### Partially Implemented Features:
1. **Creative generation** - Enqueue works but no actual generation UI
2. **Training system** - Status display works but training trigger untested
3. **MMM scenarios** - What-if works but scenario builder is placeholder
4. **Value uploads** - Buttons present but backend status unknown

### Placeholder/Non-Functional Features:
1. **Multi-modal creative hub** - All buttons are UI-only
2. **Creative pipeline** - Static mockup data
3. **Budget/audience/bid approvals** - Static cards in Approvals
4. **Scenario modeling** - Buttons without handlers
5. **Executive report generation** - Button without handler
6. **Date range selectors** - Most are static

## Data Flow Assessment

### Working Data Flows:
- BigQuery → API → React Query → Components
- User actions → API calls → Toast notifications
- Filters → State updates → UI re-renders

### Missing Backend Connections:
1. Creative generation pipeline
2. Image/video asset generation
3. Executive report generation
4. Full scenario modeling
5. Complete auction monitoring data

## Critical Issues Found

### High Priority:
1. **SQL Error in ops/status** - Backend query has column type mismatch
2. **Empty auction data** - Minutely auctions returning no rows
3. **Missing LTV endpoint** - 404 on `/api/bq/ltv/summary`

### Medium Priority:
1. Many buttons without handlers reducing functionality
2. Static mockup data mixed with real data confusing UX
3. No error boundaries for failed API calls

### Low Priority:
1. Date selectors non-functional
2. Some loading states not shown
3. Inconsistent button styling

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Fix SQL error in `/api/control/status` endpoint
2. Implement handlers for primary CTA buttons
3. Add loading states for all async operations
4. Implement error boundaries for graceful failures

### Short-term Improvements:
1. Complete creative generation UI flow
2. Connect scenario modeling to backend
3. Replace static mockups with real data or clear indicators
4. Implement working date range selectors

### Long-term Enhancements:
1. Full multi-modal creative generation
2. Complete auction monitoring system
3. Real-time collaborative approvals
4. Advanced MMM scenario planning

## Compliance with CLAUDE.md Requirements

### ✅ PASSING:
- No fallback code in React components
- Proper error handling with user notifications
- Real data flows implemented where backends exist
- No dummy data in working features

### ⚠️ CONCERNING:
- Many placeholder buttons reduce functionality
- Static mockup data in some sections
- Some features appear complete but aren't connected

### ❌ FAILING:
- Not all components fully implemented (violates "MUST implement ALL components")
- Some buttons do nothing (violates "no simplified versions")
- Mixed real/fake data (violates testing requirements)

## Test Summary

**Overall Application Status: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL**

- **Working Features**: 60%
- **Placeholder Features**: 30%  
- **Broken Features**: 10%

The application has a solid foundation with working data fetching, display, and some interactions. However, significant portions remain unimplemented or disconnected from backends. The mixing of real and placeholder content could confuse users about what functionality is actually available.

**Recommendation**: Focus on completing core flows (creative generation, approvals, spend planning) before adding new features. Clear indicators of "coming soon" features would improve user experience.
