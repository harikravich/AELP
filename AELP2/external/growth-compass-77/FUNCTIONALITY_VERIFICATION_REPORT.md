# AELP2 Functionality Verification Report

## Executive Summary
This report verifies whether the "working" buttons and features in the AELP2 UI actually perform their intended functions correctly. The investigation reveals that most features marked as "working" are actually **pseudo-functional** - they execute code but don't perform real actions.

## Critical Finding: Most "Working" Features Are Fake

### üî¥ MAJOR ISSUES DISCOVERED:

1. **Training Run**: Generates FAKE synthetic data, not real training
2. **Creative Publish**: Just updates database status, doesn't publish anything
3. **Creative Enqueue**: Only adds to queue, no actual creative generation
4. **Bandit Apply**: Requires special flag `AELP2_ALLOW_BANDIT_MUTATIONS=1` which is NOT set
5. **Scale Winner**: Same as enqueue - just adds to queue

## Detailed Feature Verification

### 1. ‚ùå Approvals Workflow (`/api/control/creative/publish`)

**What it claims to do:** Publish approved creatives to Google Ads
**What it actually does:**
```typescript
// Just updates database status to 'processed'
// Sets status='paused_created' (not actually created)
// No actual Google Ads API calls
// No creative publishing happens
```

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Updates BigQuery table `creative_publish_queue`
- ‚ùå Does NOT actually publish to Google Ads
- ‚ùå Hardcoded `platform_ids` with null values
- ‚ùå Always returns `status: 'paused_created'` regardless of action

**VERDICT: FAKE - Just database updates, no real publishing**

### 2. ‚ùå Scale Winner / Creative Enqueue (`/api/control/creative/enqueue`)

**What it claims to do:** Scale winning creatives or generate new ones
**What it actually does:**
```typescript
// Only inserts a row into creative_publish_queue
// No actual scaling logic
// No creative generation
// Just queues with status='queued'
```

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Creates queue entry in BigQuery
- ‚ùå No creative generation pipeline
- ‚ùå No scaling logic implementation
- ‚ùå No follow-up processing

**VERDICT: FAKE - Only queues, doesn't scale or generate**

### 3. ‚ùå Training Run (`/api/control/training-run`)

**What it claims to do:** Trigger RL model training
**What it actually does:**
```python
# training_stub.py - Line 64-70:
auctions = steps * random.randint(80, 120)  # RANDOM!
win_rate = random.uniform(0.2, 0.4)  # RANDOM!
spend = args.budget * random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)  # RANDOM!
conversions = int(max(1.0, random.uniform(0.5, 2.0) * wins / max(auctions,1) * 50))  # RANDOM!
```

**Verification:**
- ‚ùå Generates SYNTHETIC random data
- ‚ùå No actual RL training
- ‚ùå No model updates
- ‚ùå Just writes fake episodes to BigQuery
- ‚ùå File is literally named `training_stub.py`

**VERDICT: COMPLETELY FAKE - Random number generator disguised as training**

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Spend Planner Deploy (`/api/control/bandit-apply`)

**What it claims to do:** Deploy budget allocation changes
**What it actually does:**
```typescript
// Line 8-10: Checks for AELP2_ALLOW_BANDIT_MUTATIONS flag
if ((process.env.GATES_ENABLED || '1') === '1' && 
    (process.env.AELP2_ALLOW_BANDIT_MUTATIONS || '0') !== '1') {
  return NextResponse.json({ ok: false, error: 'flag_denied' })
}
```

**Verification:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gated behind environment flag (likely disabled)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Calls `bandit_orchestrator.py` if enabled
- ‚ùì Actual functionality depends on Python script
- ‚ùå Default configuration blocks execution

**VERDICT: DISABLED BY DEFAULT - Requires manual flag activation**

### 5. ‚ùå Value Uploads to Meta/Google

**Files not found:**
- `/api/control/value-upload/meta` - MISSING
- `/api/control/value-upload/google` - MISSING

**VERDICT: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Endpoints don't exist**

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Chat Endpoint (`/api/chat`)

**Status:** Not found in dashboard app
**VERDICT: NOT IMPLEMENTED**

## API Backend Architecture Issues

### Wrong Application Running on Port 8080
- **Current:** Vite preview server for `growth-compass-77` (frontend only)
- **Expected:** Next.js server from `AELP2/apps/dashboard` with API routes
- **Impact:** API calls hit the wrong server, some work by accident

### Server Mismatch Evidence:
```bash
# Running on 8080:
node .../growth-compass-77/node_modules/.bin/vite preview --port 8080

# Should be running:
cd AELP2/apps/dashboard && npm run dev  # Next.js with API routes
```

## Violations of CLAUDE.md Requirements

### CRITICAL VIOLATIONS:

1. **"NEVER use simplified versions"**
   - ‚ùå training_stub.py is literally a stub with random data
   
2. **"NEVER use mock implementations"**
   - ‚ùå All training data is randomly generated
   - ‚ùå Creative publish is mock (no real publishing)
   
3. **"MUST handle errors by FIXING them"**
   - ‚ùå SQL error in status endpoint not fixed
   - ‚ùå Missing endpoints return 404s
   
4. **"MUST ensure data flows through entire system"**
   - ‚ùå Data stops at queue tables, no follow-through
   - ‚ùå No actual integration with Google Ads
   
5. **"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS: `TODO` or `FIXME`"**
   - ‚ùå training_stub.py is essentially a TODO implementation

## Real vs Fake Feature Summary

### ‚úÖ Actually Working (Data Display Only):
- Fetching and displaying BigQuery data
- Calculating metrics (CAC, ROAS, etc.)
- Rendering charts and visualizations
- Filtering and sorting data

### ‚ùå Fake/Broken "Working" Features:
- Training Run - generates random data
- Creative Publishing - only updates DB status
- Creative Enqueue/Scale - only adds to queue
- Value Uploads - endpoints missing
- Bandit Deploy - disabled by default

### üü° Partially Working:
- Approvals Queue - displays real queue but publish is fake
- MMM What-if - calculations work but no deployment

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Wrong Server Running:** Frontend preview server instead of Next.js backend
2. **Stub Implementations:** Core features use stub/mock code
3. **Missing Integration:** No real Google Ads API integration
4. **Disabled Features:** Key features gated behind unset flags
5. **Incomplete Pipeline:** Queue systems exist but no processors

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. **Stop the current server and start the correct one:**
   ```bash
   # Kill current process on 8080
   # Start: cd AELP2/apps/dashboard && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Replace ALL stub implementations:**
   - Replace training_stub.py with real training
   - Implement actual creative publishing
   - Add real Google Ads API integration

3. **Fix or remove broken features:**
   - Either implement or clearly mark as "Coming Soon"
   - Don't pretend features work when they don't

4. **Enable feature flags for testing:**
   - Set AELP2_ALLOW_BANDIT_MUTATIONS=1 if testing needed

### The Truth About "Working" Features:
**Almost everything marked as "working" is actually fake.** The UI successfully calls endpoints that successfully do nothing useful. This violates every principle in CLAUDE.md about no fallbacks, no mocks, and ensuring everything works properly.

## Conclusion

The AELP2 application is in a **prototype state** with a well-designed UI but almost no real backend functionality. What appears to be working is mostly theater - database updates and random data generation disguised as real features. 

**Current State: 10% Real, 90% Fake**

The application needs significant backend development before it can be considered functional, let alone production-ready.
