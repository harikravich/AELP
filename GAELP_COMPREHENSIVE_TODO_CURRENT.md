## üéØ IMMEDIATE TODO (BUSINESS DEPLOYMENT)

### **Phase 1: Real Data Calibration (1-2 days)**
- [ ] **Connect discovery engine to real GA4 data** (replace simulation calls with MCP functions)
- [ ] **Validate real patterns vs simulation** (conversion rates, user behavior)
- [ ] **Calibrate simulation parameters** with discovered patterns
- [ ] **Run end-to-end integration test** (GA4 ‚Üí agent ‚Üí decisions)

### **Phase 2: Small-Scale Real Money Testing (Week 1)**
- [ ] **Set up personal Google Ads account** ($1000 daily limit)
- [ ] **Set up personal Facebook Ads account** ($500 daily limit)
- [ ] **Configure cross-account attribution** (personal ads ‚Üí Aura GA4)
- [ ] **Launch $100/day behavioral health campaign** (Aura Balance positioning)
- [ ] **Monitor real conversion tracking** end-to-end

### **Phase 3: Content & Strategy (Week 1-2)**
- [ ] **Create behavioral health landing pages** (Balance-first messaging)
- [ ] **Generate crisis moment detection campaigns** (2AM searches)
- [ ] **Build iOS-specific targeting** (prominently address limitation)
- [ ] **Test authority signals** (CDC, AAP endorsements)

### **Phase 4: Scale Testing (Week 2-3)**
- [ ] **Scale to $500/day** if initial performance good
- [ ] **Add TikTok ads account** (younger parent demographic)
- [ ] **Build competitive conquest campaigns** ("Bark alternative")
- [ ] **Implement affiliate strategy replication** (4.42% CVR patterns)

---

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT (NON-CRITICAL)

### **Demo File Cleanup**
- [ ] Clean up 32 violations in demo files (non-production)
  - `run_full_demo.py`: Mock classes for demos
  - `example_training_run.py`: Mock classes for examples
  - `crisis_parent_training_demo.py`: Mock data generation

### **Documentation Enhancement**
- [ ] Add architectural documentation for new team members
- [ ] Create component interaction diagrams
- [ ] Document deployment procedures

---

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

### **Simulation Performance (Already Achieved)**
- [x] Agent beats baseline consistently
- [x] All 21 components integrated
- [x] No critical fallbacks in production
- [x] Safety systems prevent runaway spending

### **Real Money Performance Targets**
- [ ] **Month 1:** 2:1 ROAS on $1000/day spend
- [ ] **Month 2:** Reduce CAC from $140 to under $100
- [ ] **Month 3:** Scale to $50K/month profitably
- [ ] **Discovery:** Find non-obvious strategies humans wouldn't try

- **Positioning:** "Detect teen mood changes before you do"
- **Authority:** CDC/AAP guidelines integration
- **Advantage:** Only product with AI behavioral insights

### **Market Intelligence (From GA4)**
- **High CVR:** Direct features (5.16% vs emotional appeals 0.06%)
- **Broken Channel:** Display (150K sessions, 0.01% CVR)
- **Best Source:** Affiliates (4.42% CVR - pattern to replicate)
- **Timing:** Evening hours peak conversions

### **Technical Advantage**
- **Unique:** 21-component RL system for marketing
- **Advanced:** Multi-touch attribution with 3-14 day delays
- **Safe:** Production safeguards prevent disasters
- **Smart:** Learns from simulation + real data calibration

## üéØ NORTH STAR VISION

Build the world's first RL agent that:
1. **Learns** optimal marketing strategies in sophisticated simulation
2. **Calibrates** with real behavioral health conversion data  
3. **Deploys** safely with production guardrails
4. **Discovers** strategies humans wouldn't find
5. **Scales** Aura Balance to dominant behavioral health position

**Timeline:** 
- **Week 1:** Real data calibration + $100/day testing
- **Month 1:** $1000/day profitable scaling
- **Month 3:** $50K/day market leadership

The technical foundation is complete. Time to deploy with real money.
