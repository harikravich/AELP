## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Thompson Sampling Engine:
```python
class ThompsonSamplingStrategy:
    def sample_probability(self) -> float:
        return np.random.beta(self.alpha, self.beta)
    
    def update(self, outcome: bool, reward: float):
        if outcome:
            self.alpha += 1  # Success
        else:
            self.beta += 1   # Failure
```

### Safety Guardrails:
```python
def is_action_safe(self, action: Dict, context: Dict) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    if daily_spend + action_budget > self.max_daily_spend:
        return False, "Budget exceeded"
    return True, "Safe to proceed"
```

### A/B Testing Framework:
```python
def analyze_experiment(self, experiment_id: str) -> Dict:
    # Statistical significance with proper z-test
    z_stat = (p2 - p1) / se
    p_value = 2 * (1 - norm.cdf(abs(z_stat)))
    return {"significant": p_value < 0.05}
```
