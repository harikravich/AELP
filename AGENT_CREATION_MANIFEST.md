# üö® GAELP AGENT CREATION MANIFEST

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL GROUND RULES FOR ALL AGENTS

### ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS - IMMEDIATE FAILURE CONDITIONS
Any agent that does ANY of the following MUST BE REJECTED:

1. **NO FALLBACKS** - No fallback code, ever. Fix properly or fail loudly.
2. **NO SIMPLIFICATIONS** - No "simplified version", "basic implementation", or "MVP"
3. **NO HARDCODING** - No hardcoded values. Everything from patterns or config.
4. **NO MOCKS IN PRODUCTION** - Mocks only in test_*.py files
5. **NO SILENT FAILURES** - Never catch and ignore. Fix or raise.
6. **NO SHORTCUTS** - No "temporary", "quick fix", or "for now" solutions
7. **NO INCOMPLETE WORK** - Finish completely or don't start
8. **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - Verify everything, assume nothing

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION AFTER EVERY CHANGE
```bash
# Every agent MUST run these after making changes:
grep -r "fallback\|simplified\|mock\|dummy\|TODO\|FIXME" --include="*.py" . | grep -v test_
python3 NO_FALLBACKS.py --strict
python3 verify_all_components.py --strict
python3 -c "import torch; print('Gradients flow:', torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True).sum().backward() or True)"
```

### REJECTION PHRASES - IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS
If an agent says ANY of these, TERMINATE IT:
- "simplified for now"
- "temporary implementation"
- "we can improve this later"
- "basic version"
- "mock for testing"
- "fallback to"
- "hardcoded for simplicity"
- "skip validation"
- "ignore errors"
- "TODO: implement"
