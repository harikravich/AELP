## 🚀 HOW TO USE THE AGENTS

### Individual Agent Usage
```bash
# Fix epsilon decay issues
Task agent: Use rl-hyperparameter-optimizer to fix epsilon decay in fortified_rl_agent_no_hardcoding.py

# Implement multi-objective rewards
Task agent: Use reward-system-engineer to replace simple rewards with multi-objective system

# Connect real GA4 data
Task agent: Use real-ga4-connector to replace simulation with real GA4 data

# Monitor training
Task agent: Use convergence-monitor to detect training issues in real-time
```

### Chained Agent Usage for Complex Tasks
```bash
# Complete RL training fix (TODOs #1-5)
Task agents: 
1. Use rl-hyperparameter-optimizer to fix all hyperparameters
2. Use reward-system-engineer to implement multi-objective rewards
3. Use exploration-strategy-implementer to add UCB exploration
4. Use convergence-monitor to verify training is stable

# Fix all data issues (TODOs #6-10, #20)
Task agents:
1. Use real-ga4-connector to connect real data
2. Use fallback-eliminator to remove all fallbacks
3. Use recsim-integration-fixer to fix user simulation
4. Use delayed-reward-system to add attribution windows
```

### Orchestrated Execution
```bash
# Use project coordinator to manage all agents
Task agent: Use project-coordinator to execute all 40 TODO items using appropriate agents
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Every Agent Will:
1. **REFUSE** to implement simplified versions
2. **FAIL LOUDLY** rather than use fallbacks
3. **VERIFY** everything works after changes
4. **CHECK** that gradients still flow
5. **TEST** that training still converges
6. **REJECT** any hardcoded values

### Common Rejection Phrases Agents Will Flag:
- "simplified for now"
- "temporary implementation"
- "we can improve this later"
- "basic version"
- "mock for testing"
- "fallback to"
- "hardcoded for simplicity"

---

## 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before running any agent:
- [ ] Review agent's ground rules
- [ ] Ensure target files are backed up
- [ ] Have fallback elimination ready
- [ ] Monitor for shortcuts

After agent completes:
- [ ] Run `grep -r "fallback\|simplified\|mock" --include="*.py"`
- [ ] Run `python3 NO_FALLBACKS.py --strict`
- [ ] Verify gradients flow
- [ ] Check training converges

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Review this summary** to ensure all agents meet your standards
2. **Test an agent** on a known problematic file
3. **Start with critical fixes** (RL hyperparameters, rewards, real data)
4. **Monitor agent behavior** for any shortcuts
5. **Chain agents** for complex TODO items

---

## 💡 KEY INNOVATION

These agents are different because they:
- **Actively refuse** to take shortcuts
- **Fail rather than fallback**
- **Verify their own work**
- **Check system integrity** after changes
- **Report blockers** instead of working around them

This should solve your problem of agents claiming completion while actually implementing simplified versions.
